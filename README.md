# Python_tweet_scrape
An Introductionary Python Twitter Scraper

## Purpose
The goal of this Twitter scraper is to serve as a learning example on how
to use python to pull tweets from twitter and save them into a table for
further analysis. This code is not exhaustive and some of the code is over
simplified so as to show what is happening. I wanted to show fellow researchers
an example of how they can code their own
